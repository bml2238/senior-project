		<h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, we are developing a PHd Candidate Search Engine and Database for Suny Oswego. 
            First, the team will get information on PHD candidates from SUNY and possibly other sources. 
            Once the data is retrieved, we shall organize and store the details per respective candidate into 
            our database schema. Later, the system will then email and offer to give other candidates the chance 
            to create their own profiles, if they so choose to do so.
            For the website itself, it will function almost as a reverse job board. Candidates will put in their 
            information and SUNY Oswego (and possibly other universities) will be able to search through those 
            candidates. They will be able to use several filters such as graduation year, research speciality, 
            degree, intended/requested key topics, requirements, experiences, skills, etc.
