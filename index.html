                The Student Engagement and Career Readiness Dashboard is a mobile friendly tool for 
                business students of SUNY Oswego to keep track of and complete career readiness milestones 
                to prepare for post graduation opportunities. The Dashboard hosts activities to keep track 
                of milestones such as mock interviews, resume creation, and cover letter creation. It would 
                also keep track of career events such as career fairs and other SUNY events. The Dashboard 
                would send notifications for activities when the date is approaching or in the case of the 
                date passing and no action being taken by students. Activities can include artifacts like 
                the resume or cover letter that can be stored in a portfolio that the student and admins 
                can access. The portfolio consists of the artifacts that the student submitted alongside 
                their personal information. Possible features to include would be for administrators to run 
                reports on students based on search criteria like major, year of graduation, and school. 
                Integration with SUNY SSO, integration with handshake, and additional kinds of  information 
                in the student&apos;s portfolio such as career goals, presentations, or papers would also be possible 
                features to include.
